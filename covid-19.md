### Covid-19 Travel Notes

1. Don't forget your vaccination cards. 
    - If you are fully vaccinated (i.e. with a booster!), Ireland is not requiring a negative test upon arrival.
      
      From the Irish government's [Current rules for travelling to Ireland](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/77952-government-advice-on-international-travel/):

      > - vaccine certificates for primary vaccination series are not accepted for travel if more than 270 days have passed since the final dose in the primary vaccine series. Persons travelling with only a vaccination certificate showing their primary series must ensure that it is still in the acceptable date range
      > - vaccine certificates based on booster/additional doses are not time limited and persons travelling with this additional document are not subject to the 270 day acceptance period
      >
      > A standard acceptance period of 14 days after the final dose in a primary vaccine series of a vaccine are required for all vaccines accepted for travel to Ireland.

    - Ireland is not requiring testing upon entry with proof of vaccination:
      
      > Passengers without proof of vaccination, or proof of recovery from COVID-19 in the prior 6 months, must show evidence of a negative ('not detected') PCR test result taken within 72 hours prior to arriving in Ireland.
      >
      > **Only PCR test results are accepted for passengers to Ireland.**

    It is an offense to travel to Ireland from overseas without a pre-departure test result or full vaccination, so please make sure your paperwork is in order!

2. The [US government requires a negative test before flying home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html). This test must be taken within 1 day of departure. Testing is availble in Dublin airport. Test can also be an antigen test, BUT must be supervised via telehealth visit. You can [schedule your return testing at Dublin Airport here](https://www.dublinairport.com/covid-19/pre-departure-covid-19-testing)!
4. A [Passenger Locator Form](https://travel.eplf.gov.ie/en) is required prior to entry.  This can be completed no more than 3 days prior to arrival.
