### Food and Drink

On the wedding day, we're hosting a [Full Irish Breakfast](https://www.thespruceeats.com/full-irish-breakfast-435557) and evening reception for those staying at Springfield Castle.

For other meals, we'll plan to eat at pubs either nearby to the castle or in the area of any day trips we make. We'll also have use of the two kitchens at the castle, so we'll be able to prepare our own meals as well. We plan to stop at a Tesco grocery store to pick up some staples for ourselves, and you may want to do the same.

The castle has a pub in its basement, which will be set up with a keg of Murphy's stout for our enjoyment.

#### Reception Dinner

##### Canapes

- Craft butcher sausage rolls with relish
- Goats cheese, pesto, and pastry bites
